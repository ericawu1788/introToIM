As we are assigned to produce either data visualization or generate text output, I decided to challenge myself with data visualization. I wanted to try generating something different from what was given or demonstrated in class, which is why I decided to create on of those graphs with (x,y) coordinates where the size (of the circle on the coordinate) is based on another variable. I started off by having the class example code at the side for reference. Similarly as before, I coded based off of what I imagine them to be like and similarly, it did not work as I intended. I remember being very frustrated trying to find out where the problem lies, or in other words, when I tried to debug. I then realized the importance of having println along the way to show whether each of my steps are working as I intended. Along the way, I realized I could just generate text output using this method by pulling in data variables, which means worst case scenario, this could be my assignment. However,  I continued to look at my code, trying to print out different steps along the way. In the end, I figured out the major problem was that condition statement was "if (singleRow[3] == "2021-09-20") instead of "if (singleRow[3].equals("2021-09-20"))" which is a stupid mistake. Still, I appreciated the process for letting me understand how to check for mistakes. The graph may not be the easiest to understand as some of the circles and country names overlap. I think I will need to clean up the data a bit, or maybe trying a simpler dataset. Since I did this for practice, I also chose two variables not based on their correlation, but based variables that doesn't seem to be missing for most of the countries. Anyhow, I thought this is already a great progress for me!
