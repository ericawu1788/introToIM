Since I wanted to make a game relating to maps, I have searched it up on the internet to see if anyone has a cool way to approach it. I then encountered the library unfolding ( http://unfoldingmaps.org/tutorials/getting-started-in-processing.html ), which I though could be useful. However, when I tried to load the sample code, it had several errors that I might need help with checking. I then resorted to another plan that does not require this additional library. The game I'm thinking of is providing a map of a region and asking the player to draw where they think the river is. The system will then evaluate how close that is to the actual river and give a score to it. What I find challenging about this is giving the scoring. I might even need to change this topic later if it is actually too hard, but I think it's worth a shot.
