I'm thinking of making a virtual claw machine where I use Processing to show the graphics of prizes and dolls in the claw machine. For Arduino, I'll use it for the knob and buttons to control the claw on Processing. Something worth considering would be how I'll need to make it 3D as a real life claw machine can be seen through different dimensions. I can also look through how others have made their claw machine games. At the same time, I will also look at other examples of games to get inspired on either making other games or making adjustments of this claw machine game.
