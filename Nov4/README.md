For the Arduino code, I looked at the classroom example and made some modification towards the blinking time. I have decided to use one switch for both the LEDs. For the breadboard, I have tried to make it as simple and clear as possible. For this assignment, we are focusing on coming up with an unique switch, so that is what I've spend the most time on - getting the switch to work. I went to the IM Lab to find materials to work with. I picked up a copper paper and a piece of metal from the junk bin. I first tested whether they could be conductive or not and found out they are both conductive. I then thought about how to connect and disconnect them without the use of hand. I then decided to take advantage of the light weight of the copper paper by blowing it to allow the two objects to touch. As I tried it out, I realized it could become a game - because could, not necessarily, be a bit challenging. I have also tried to make it easier for the two objects to touch, such as adjusting the metal piece so that it can stand with four legs. for the copper paper, I have folded it to add more potential touching surface. When testing the conductiviy of the copper paper, I have realized the surface with the sticky part is less stable regarding conductivity. I then made sure the connecting surfaces, the part that connects the copper paper to the jumper wire and what would touch the metal piece, are on the non-sticky side of the copper paper. I personally found this first exercise reflective of what we've learned in class with a creative twist, allowing us toget familiar in physical computing creativity. This also allowed me to step out of the comfort zone of the arduino kit and loot at other objects to incorporate in.
