For this assignment, I watched the lecture several times to make sure I'm following through. I then took the sample code and the ones used in class as my assignment. Along the way, there were still some bumps I had to get through. For one of the codes, I was trying very hard to figure out the problem to realize that my resistor was not plugged in properly. Other times it was a line of code I missed as I rewatched the lecture. What I spent the longest time on, however, was my the game I created. I modified my snake game from midterm by making it simpler. I decided to do this because I have already established style and game features set up, such as the pause and play again function. In this version, however, the snake doesn't increase in length, nor can it travel up or down - only left or right. Although the game itself is simpler, I added Arduino components so that there is communication on both ways between Arduino and Processing. For Arduino to Processing, I used a switch as sensor to change direction (left or right) of the snake by using the state machine on the processing side. For Processing to Arduino, the LED lights up whenever the snake successfully eats the apple. I've also gotten stuck several times. However, along the way, I realized I am understanding their communication better as I adjust my codes to make them work. From not knowing where the problem lies to successfully debugging them, I gave mself the opportunity to challenge myself and work out something out of my comfort zone. I have also utilized my past code of the state machine to serve as the Arduino to Processing portion of the game. 

Here are the media documentation of the game. Other photos and videos are in their folders
