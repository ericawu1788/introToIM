As I looked at Michael's demonstration of the rotating rectangles in class, I thought to myself: "maybe if I stare longer at it, I'll get an inspiration to my object oriented programming project." Indeed, I thought about making flowers formed of dots that extend from the center. I then studied the code we formed in class to create a class of Flower. Because my idea originated from the drawing Flower itself, I started by coding the for loops in which I think would make up the flower. As I was coding, I realized the variables I need, which I then added to and defined in the class. I figured my way of coding: I write down whatever code I find logical to make it work all at once and try to run them, partially hoping they'll work right away. After running them and finding the errors, I might find I was not too far what what I was looking for and then fix the errors. For this assignment, however, the final product was actually not what I intended but I thought it turned out better than what I was expecting as they have more variations. I made spiral flowers (or maybe fireworks) when I initially intended them to be straight lines like dandelions. Due to the draw function, it would've kept running without stopping. I then added a conditional statement to reset the background after 50 flowers. I then thought of alternating different color schemes for each round of 50 flowers. I then added different of color that could be alternated in the class and adding an argument for drawFlowers. 

I would say the main challenge or improvement I should make would be to figure out how to make what I initially intended. I didn't look into that but instead added variations such as the color change because I view this as an art process, in which I should follow through with whatever I find works. I understand I should still figure it out to improve my coding skills. However, during this process, I also realized that if you look at the artwork for a bit longer, you could find more things to do with it and develop it more. Initially my artwork was just composed of flowers in different colors, which look great already. However, I thought setting a range for the color for a cohesive color scheme could make it even better. This shows how there is always more to experiment. I stopped here because I thought this works just about right and I find it very pretty.

I am generally really proud of this artwork because I really enjoyed the process. Although I what I intended to code did not turn out how I wanted it to be, it unexpectedly worked really well for me in a way I didn't think I would've been able to code.
