For this assingment, I started by working on the analog sensor, for which I chose the potentiometer. I tested it out with the speaker like we did in class. As I tested it out, I realized it was making sound, but sound is very soft. I then made sure my code makes sense and even searched online for potential solutions. As I checked my breadboard again, however, I realized the a wire wasn't connected properly, either the ground wire or the 5V wire. What was interesting for me was that the breadboard was actually the last thing I checked. This is because I thought since my components are making sound, the problem is probably not on them. In other words, what was interesting for me was that even though it wasn't connected properly, it still made a bit of sound. This again shows that even though it is halfway working, there could still be a mistake. 

I then worked on the second part, which would be integrating the digital sensor, for which I chose switch, into the circuit. I decided to modify the code I had last time. I pasted the code in initially, realized it works partially, and then made adjustment to the code. I incorporated three modes that the switch changes into, each with a different range of pitch for the potentiometer. I also tested out several ranges as my initial range was too big that it doesn't sound too good. In the end, I ended up with a musical instrument where I can play by turning the knob of the potentiometer to change pitch gradually. When you press the switch, I get to change the pitch by a segment (not gradually) onto another range. This means as I press the switch continuously, the pitch will jump around between the three modes/ranges. 

This is what the circuit looks like:
