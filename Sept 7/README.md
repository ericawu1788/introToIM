  Some difficulties I faced was trying to draw a curved line, for which I might still need to figure out, but I found another solution that could pass. I also faced some difficulty trying to find the shape I want, or combining shapes. For instance, I am not exactly sure how to draw the shape at the bottom; so I made the color of the bottom shape as the background while using a huge arc (I later realized a circle could also work). Another difficulty I faced was making the head ellipse match with the shape beside it to create one object. After working on this, I am thinking that I could've sketched it before I coded it. Another difficulty I faced was trying to plan or see what I want to look like in the self-portrait. I then thought of this image I drew for which I resonate with a lot, which is a person, or mother earth, facing the sky, taking in the sun and flourish into ocean or land as the base.
