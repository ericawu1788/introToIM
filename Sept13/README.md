(I would like to mention that I made the artwork before watching the video, meaning that I did not directly take inspiration from the artwork shown in the video, but whether or not I've seen similar artwork in the past, I do not know for sure.)

I thought of creating random lines that connect with each other. I then realized it could be done by setting the ending coordinates of one line to the next line's starting coordinates. I put it in void draw{} initially but realized that it just doesn't stop. I then used a for loop and found repeating 500 times to be around the density I like. I also found out a single color would not show the layering of the lines, which is why I decided to alter the color of the line by a certain variable consistently (and reverse once it reaches the end). I've tried it with one of the RGB values initially, but the problem was that the colors of the line were not clear and that I did not like the color. To solve this, I came up with a solution to make the color alter in the black and white spectrum, for which the RGB values are the same as they change; this also made the lines clearer. I've discovered that I would need to understand the RGB combination of colors better if I were to However, this made the lines too simple as an artwork, so I decided to play with the background so that it's more vibrant. I then searched up a gradient background code online. I found a code and altered the color and stroke of the background. I thought the result looks pretty interesting in a way I find comfortable with.
